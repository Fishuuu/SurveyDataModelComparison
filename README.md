# Modeling Self-Reported Survey Data: A Comparative Study of Tabular Methods

## Overview
This research evaluates and compares the performance of machine learning methods in modeling self-reported survey data for a binary classification task. Self-reported survey data often presents unique challenges, such as missing responses, subjective biases, and variability in feature importance. By benchmarking advanced tabular modeling approaches, this work aims to identify the most effective methods for accurately and reliably analyzing such data.

### Algorithms Compared
1. **Deep Learning Models**:
   - GatedTabTransformer
   - FT-Transformer
   - GANDALF
2. **Ensemble Tree Models**:
   - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
   - Random Forest

### Evaluation Metrics
AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity, F1 score
